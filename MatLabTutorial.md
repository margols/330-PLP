# The Histroy of MATLAB 
**In the Beginning:**

- Mat Lab was started by Cleve Molar in the University of New Mexico to offer his students easier access to LINPACK and EISPACK without writing Fortran programs.
- MatLab is short for Matrix Laboratory and the program written in fortran. Originally there were only 71 reserved words and functions built in as its main purpose was to be an interactive matrix calculator
- In 1983, Jack Little and Steve Bangert wrote a new extended version of MATLAB in C which included new aspects including functions, toolboxes and graphics.
- In 1984 MatLab became a commercially available product which was proposed by Little and bangert in 1983. 

**Modern MatLab:**

- The current MattLab program includes the addition of a numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODE) as well as the expansion of data types. 
- Furthermore, in 1996 structures and associated dot notation were added.
- Objects were added in 2008, enhancing MatLab's object oriented programming capabilities 
- Separate windows for graphics,editing and other tools were added in 2000 along with the MatLab desktop. 
- In 2016 the live editor was introduced which combines descriptive text, input, output and graphics into one interactive document. 
- Today MatLab is used in a wide range of fields, focusing on everything from deep and machine learning to computational finance and biology.
- Some companies using MatLab today are:
    - SpaceX, Intel, and General Atomics
    - The most popular use of MatLab is in Information Technology, followed by higher education and computer software

# Getting Started 
Installing MatLab:
MatLab is available for a 30 day free trial follow this link: [Downloading MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/message/error_page/unlicensed?release=R2022b)
  - Most university's have licenses or have the software downloaded on a Virutal Machine

Follow the instructions prompted through the download, MatLab comes with a programming enviornment so there is no need to download an external programming environment. 

### Writing Comments in MatLab
- The symbol % can be used to comment in MatLab
``` cadence 
%this is how you write a comment
``` 

- In order to run code press the Run Selection button on the toolbar.

## Writing "Hello World"

Using the fprintf() statemnet outputs a formated string

Using disp(x) displays the value in the variable x
Source: [MATLAB Function Reference](http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/local-apps/matlabhelp/techdoc/ref/display.html#:~:text=display%20(MATLAB%20Functions)&text=display(X)%20prints%20the%20value,sin(A)%3B%20does%20not.)  

Either format above will display Hello World in the Command Window
