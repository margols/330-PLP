# The Histroy of MATLAB 
**In the Beginning:**

- Mat Lab was started in a university classroom to offer students easier access to LINPACK and EISPACK without writing Fortran programs.
- MatLab is short for Matrix Laboratory and the program written in fortran. Originally there were only 71 reserved words and functions built in as its main purpose was to be an interactive matrix calculator
- In 1983, Jack Little and Steve Bangert wrote a new extended version of MATLAB in C which included new aspects including functions, toolboxes and graphics.
- In 1984 MatLab became a commercially available product which was proposed by Little and bangert in 1983. 

**Modern MatLab:**

- The current MattLab program includes the addition of a numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODE) as well as the expansion of data types. 
- Furthermore, in 1996 structures and associated dot notation were added.
- Objects were added in 2008, enhancing MatLab's object oriented programming capabilities 
- Separate windows for graphics,editing and other tools were added in 2000 along with the MatLab desktop. 
- In 2016 the live editor was introduced which combines descriptive text, input, output and graphics into one interactive document. 
- Today MatLab is used in a wide range of fields, focusing on everything from deep and machine learning to computational finance and biology.
