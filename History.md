Modern MatLab:
Addition of numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODE) 
Expansion of data types
1996 structures and associated dot notation was added 
Objects were added in 2008 enhancing the object oriented programming capabilities 
Separate windows for graphics,editing and other tools were added
